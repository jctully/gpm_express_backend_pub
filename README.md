## After cloning repo

### 1. Install dependencies:

`$ cd gpm_express_backend`

`$ npm install`

#### To check that its running:

`$ nodemon server`

You should now see an output similar to the following:

### 2. Install MongoDB

#### *The following instructions are for MacOS, to install MongoDB for windows, follow the tutorial [here](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/mongo-windows.html).* 

On MacOS this task can be completed by using the following command:

`$ brew install mongodb`

Having installed MongoDB on your system you need to create a data directory which is used by MongoDB:

`$ mkdir -p /data/db`

*Before running the next command, make sure you have read and write privileges for the directory.*

Now weâ€™re ready to start up MongoDB by executing the following command:

`$ mongod`

This should output: 

![mongod output](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/857/0*JEC4FJ-yg3rdlmDt.png)

This shows that the database is now running on port 27017 and is waiting to accept client connections.

*This instance should be kept running in its own terminal session.*

### 3. Create new MongoDB database

*Make sure you're running* `$ mongod` *in a separate terminal session.*

`$ mongo`

Once you're connected, switch to a new database *todos*:

`use todos`

Once that is done, you can exit `mongo`:

`exit`

### 4. Run the back-end

To start the server:

`npm start`

*Make sure you are running* `mongod` *in one session, and* `npm start` *in another.*
